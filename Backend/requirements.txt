langchain-community
langchain-core
langchain-huggingface
langchain-text-splitters

# --- API Server Libraries ---
# Used to run the FastAPI application
fastapi
uvicorn[standard]
pydantic

# --- Embedding and Vector Store Libraries ---
# Used for creating and querying FAISS vector stores
# sentence-transformers is the core embedding model
# faiss-cpu is the vector store (CPU-version is fine on Mac/Windows without CUDA)
# torch is a dependency for sentence-transformers and used explicitly in scripts

# --- Document Processing Libraries ---
# Used in the scripts to parse and clean source documents
PyMuPDF        # For PDF parsing (import fitz)
python-docx    # For .docx parsing (import docx)
spacy          # For text splitting and processing
regex          # For advanced regex operations in splitting
pillow         # Required by PIL import in first_process_corpus.py
pytesseract    # Required for OCR fallback in first_process_corpus.py

# --- Utilities & Evaluation ---
# Used by helper scripts and the evaluation client
requests       # For evaluation/client.py and scripts/ikapi.py (if used)
tqdm           # For progress bars in data processing scripts

# --- Evaluation Add-ons ---
rouge-score    # For ROUGE metrics in evaluation
rapidfuzz      # For fuzzy mapping case_name -> source
pandas         # For result tables and CSV export
google-generativeai>=0.9.0  # For optional Gemini LLM evaluation; align with google-ai-generativelanguage>=0.9
